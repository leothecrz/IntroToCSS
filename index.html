            About Me:
        </h2>
        <p>
            Im a <em>4th year CS major</em> at CPP. Ever since my family decided to get a PC
            when I was around 5-7 years old I been facinated with technology. I began my coding journey with
            <i>SCRACH</i>, which was developed by <abbr title="Massachusetts Institute of Technology">MIT</abbr> Media Lab.
            It was very high-level and restrictive but we all need a start somewhere. I would eventually branch
            and learn more modern and low-level languages as my project ideas started to grow. I 
            am mostly self taught.

                <h4>Sports</h4>
                    I have been playing basketball for as long as i can remeber. I once had ambitions to play
                    profesionally but my curiosity of technology won out. I still play.
                <h4>Gaming</h4>
                    One of my favorite pass times. I became a gamer as a kid when i was gifted a 
                    Game Boy Color. I've since obtained a DS, PSP, 2DS, 3DS, Switch, PS4, PS5, and my PC.
