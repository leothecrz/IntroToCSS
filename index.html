            About Me:
        </h2>

        <p>
            <h3>CS:</h3>
            Im a <em>4th year CS major</em> at CPP. Ever since my family decided to get a PC
            when I was around 5-7 years old I been facinated with technology. I began my coding journey with
            <i>SCRACH</i>, which was developed by <abbr title="Massachusetts Institute of Technology">MIT</abbr> Media Lab.
            It was very high-level and restrictive but we all need a start somewhere. I would eventually branch
            and learn more modern and low-level languages as my project ideas started to grow. I 
            am mostly self taught.

            <p>
                <h4>Sports</h4>
                    I have been playing basketball for as long as i can remeber. I once had ambitions to play
                    profesionally but my curiosity of technology won out. I still play.
                    <br>
                    I also play football(Soccer). I play like i have two left feet, so i am most suited to play as the Goal-Keeper.

                <h4>Gaming</h4>
                    One of my favorite pass times. I became a gamer as a kid when i was gifted a 
                    Game Boy Color. I've since obtained a DS, PSP, 2DS, 3DS, Switch, PS4, PS5, and my PC.
                
                <h4>Anime</h4>
                    Starting early on with Pokemon and Beyblade i have been enjoying Japanase animation since I was a kid. At this point i have seen
                    countless amounts of shows and films. One of my all-time favorites is <i>"Astra - Lost in space"<i>

                <h4>Gym</h4>
                    <h5>WIP</h5>
                <h4>Reading</h4>
                    It took me a long time to enjoy reading as a past-time but it evetually did. I have a preferance for fiction, but
                    I do not mind reading history and philosophy. 
                <h4>Art</h4>
                    When i was in middle school and highschool i enjoyed sketching and drawing, but i found myself with less and less free-time
                    I do not sketch as often as I would like to.
